        <p>The hype for Grand Theft Auto VI is reaching fever pitch. A new report from a trusted industry insider claims that the map of Leonida (the game's version of Florida) will be significantly larger than Los Santos.</p>

        <p>According to the leak, the map isn't just wide—it's deep. The claim is that nearly 70% of buildings will have enterable interiors. This would be a technological marvel if true.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-2">Vice City Reimagined</h3>
        <p>The map is said to include the main city, vast swamps, smaller surrounding towns, and even a fully functional space center. The weather system has also been overhauled to include realistic hurricanes and flooding events.</p>

      summary: "Hardware manufacturers are reportedly gearing up for 'Pro' versions of current-gen consoles with significant AI upscaling capabilities.",

        <p>The console war is about to heat up again. Sources close to supply chains indicate that major manufacturers are securing components for a mid-cycle refresh slated for late 2025 or early 2026.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The focus of these new machines seems to be AI-driven upscaling (similar to DLSS) and stable 60FPS ray-tracing performance. This could bridge the gap between high-end PCs and living room consoles.</p>
